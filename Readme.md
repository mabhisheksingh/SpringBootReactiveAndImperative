## keynote while using admin client  in application
```text
If you already using Spring Cloud Discovery for your applications you donâ€™t have to add the Spring Boot Admin Client to your applications. 
Just make the Spring Boot Admin Server a DiscoveryClient, the rest is done by our AutoConfiguration.

The following steps are for using Eureka, but other Spring Cloud Discovery implementations are supported as well. 
There are examples using Consul and Zookeeper.

Also, have a look at the Spring Cloud documentation.
```

## Config needs to change in Admin client side
#### Define port and server in the client 
For Sprig boot admin server visit here [Spring boot Admin server](https://github.com/mabhisheksingh/SpringBootAdminServer) 
```yaml
server:
  port: 8081
  address: 127.0.0.1

```
#### Define the admin server URL and out instance name on the client side.
```yaml
spring:
  boot:
    admin:
      client:
        auto-registration: true
        enabled: true
        url: http://localhost:9000
        instance:
          name: my-client-1
  application:
    name: WebFluxSpringApplication
```
